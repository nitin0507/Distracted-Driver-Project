# Distracted-Driver-Project



We've all been there: a light turns green and the car in front of you doesn't budge. Or, a previously unremarkable vehicle suddenly slows and starts swerving from side-to-side.

When you pass the offending driver, what do you expect to see? You certainly aren't surprised when you spot a driver who is texting, seemingly enraptured by social media, or in a lively hand-held conversation on their phone.
According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year.

## 1. Task: Given the dataset consisting of driver images in car and corresponding labels for 10 nos. categories (e.g. safe driving, texting, talking etc.), your task is to build a classification model to predict the category for that image.
